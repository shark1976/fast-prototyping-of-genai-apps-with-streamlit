# Lab 2: Using GenAI for Sentiment Analysis

In this lab, you'll build a product intelligence dashboard and deploy it on Streamlit in Snowflake (SiS).

## Creating the App
1. Open [Snowsight](https://app.snowflake.com/)
2. In the sidebar, click on the *"Projects"* button then click on *"Streamlit"* (or click on the direct link to [Streamlit in Snowflake](https://app.snowflake.com/_deeplink/#/streamlit-apps)) 
3. Click the blue *"+ Streamlit App"* button
4. Fill out the App location by selecting `AVALANCHE_DB` as the database and `AVALANCHE_SCHEMA` as the schema.
5. Click on the blue `Create` button.
6. After a few moments the default app should spin up where you'll find 3 panels (going from left to right): File/Database panel, Code panel and the App Preview panel.

## Install Prerequisite Library
1. Click on *Packages* in the middle Code panel
2. This should bring up an Anaconda Packages management modal.
3. In the "Find Packages" text box, enter the following Python packages:
   - `matplotlib`
   - `pandas`
   - `snowflake-ml-python`

If you're seeing an error due to library dependency error, then copy the contents of [environment.yml](environment.yml) and paste it into the `environment.yml` file in Snowsight as shown in the following screenshot.

## Building the App
1. In the Streamlit in Snowflake app, copy contents of [`M2Lab2_solution.py`](M2Lab2_solution.py) and paste it into the middle Code panel
2. On the top right corner you should see the blue *"Run"* button, click on it and the app should render in a few moments.
3. Congrats! The app should appear in the app preview panel on the right.
